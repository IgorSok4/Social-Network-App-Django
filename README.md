Second project as an introduction to Django. Application created with the help of Antonio Mele's book "Django 3 By Example".

The application allows for user authentication using the Django authentication framework and its modifications, uploading photos using a URL address, liking photos, following users and tracking their activity on the website.

The code includes AJAX requests using jQuery, AJAX pagination for list views, the contenttypes framework, and a jQuery bookmarklet (to be refined).
